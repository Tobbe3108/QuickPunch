I have an app idea that I’d like to bring to life. Can you help me turn this idea into a structured project plan?
Specifically, I need your expertise to:

Clarify and document the app’s goals, target users, and key features.
Break down the project into actionable phases and tasks.
Estimate timelines, resources, and potential risks.
Identify the team members and stakeholders needed for each phase.
Set up a process for tracking progress, managing changes, and ensuring quality.
Advise on best practices for communication and feedback throughout the project.
Please guide me through each step and provide a clear roadmap I can follow from concept to launch.
